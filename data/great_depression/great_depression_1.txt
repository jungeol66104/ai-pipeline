1929:The Wall Street Crash Sparks The Depression

1929 March 4: Herbert Hoover assumes office as the President of the United States.Hoover got a bad reputation as the Great Depression began, since his laissez-faire approach to economics didn’t help relieve the situation. In his belief, capitalism could prevent any major economic downturn through a free-market economy, therefore he didn’t want the economy to be well regulated. He assumed the crash and the depression would be over quickly, and that government interference was unnecessary.

1929 August: This month, the prosperity achieved throughout the Roaring Twenties would reach its peak before beginning to downfall. This was as a result of numerous factors that came before the Wall Street Crash. When things started to look a bit bleak, the discount rate was increased from 5% to 6% by the Federal Reserve in order to support the gold standard and stop inflation.

1929 September 3: After today, it would be 25 years before the stock market would reach its pre-Wall Street Crash high.

1929 October 24: Black Thursday prompts the start of the stock market crash, which plunged the country and eventually the rest of the world into the depression. Immediately, the price of stocks drops by 11%, but with Wall Street bankers buying the stocks, only 2% was lost.

1929 October 28: Stock prices fall by 13% today, making the day become known as Black Monday.

1929 November 23: Sideways trading begins when the stock market plummeted to the bottom. Unaware of the trouble coming, President Hoover states that:“Any lack of confidence in the economic future or the basic strength of business in the United States is foolish.”Unemployment Rate: 3.2% – unemployment had not been hit hard yet, since it would lag behind any effects of the stock market.herbert hoover great depressionHerbert Hoover, 31st President of the United StatesImage: PikrepoBack to the top ↑


1930:The Dust Bowls Begin

1930 March: Since the Wall Street Crash, another 1.5 million people had been made unemployed. Despite this, President Hoover remains to be positive about the situation, claiming that: “all the evidences indicate that the worst effects of the crash upon unemployment will have passed during the next sixty days.”

1930 June 17: Taxes on 900 different imports are raised when President Hoover signs the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. Its aim was to support farmers, but hundreds of other goods ended up having tariffs imposed. This impacted international trade which began to fall, since other countries reacted to these tariffs. The tariff didn’t have a huge effect on the American economy, but caused many problems in Europe.Around the same time, a drought hits 23 states across the US, affecting those from the mid-Atlantic region to the Mississippi River. This was the beginning of the Dust Bowls, which became characteristic of the 1930s farmers’ struggle. As well as a struggling economy, the land was unable to be used to grow crops, pushing many farmers out of their land. This is appropriately depicted in the novels by John Steinbeck, namely Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath.The Dust Bowl would soon become the worst drought in 300 years, with Hoover originally asking the American Red Cross to support those in need. Later on, as things got worse, Congress provided $65 million for food boxes, seed and feed for farmers.

1930 November 7: Causing failures in associated banks in the days that followed, the Bank of Tennessee fails. Weaknesses in the banking system were having an effect on the economy as it was slowly growing, ultimately bringing it back down again.By the end of 1930, over 1,300 banks would fail as depositors hurried to withdraw their life savings. Since the banks only hold a small percentage of deposits, they can fail very quickly, especially with the amount of people asking for their money.

1930 November: In New York City, apple-sellers crowd the streets as around 6,000 unemployed people begin selling apples at five cents each.Unemployment Rate: 8.7% – the economy would shrink by 8.5% and prices fell by 6.4%, firmly allowing inflation to sink in.The industrial production of the United States had fallen by half, and soup kitchens, bread lines and large numbers of homeless people became common in America’s cities.Shanty towns erupted across the nation, known as “Hoovervilles,” named after the President whom many believed was incompetent, and reluctant, in dealing with the depression.dust bowl 1930sA dust bowl in Oklahoma, 1930sImage: PikrepoBack to the top ↑

A store owner pulled out a gun to stop the robbers, but ended up having his arm broken as he jumped up to defend. 100 policemen managed to bring the riots under control and 7 people were arrested as a result.As unemployment continued, a lot of hatred towards foreign workers began to surface. Mexican Americans in Los Angeles were accused of stealing jobs from “true” Americans, and 6,024 were deported during this month.Eight states in the South were the worst affected by the drought as it continued, creating the worst Arkansas would see in the 20th century. It was also at this time that the citizens of American would really begin to struggle with the worst effects of the depression.

President Hoover then brought the top income tax rate up to 25% as he was concerned about budget deficits.
